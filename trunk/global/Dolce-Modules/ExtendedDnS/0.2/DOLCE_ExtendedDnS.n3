	dc:description "We are proposing here a restrictive notion of goal that relies upon its desirability by some agent, which does not necessarily play a role in the execution of the plan the goal is a part of. For example, an agent can have an attitude towards some task defined in a plan, e.g. duty towards, which is different from desiring it (desire towards). We might say that a goal is usually desired by the creator or beneficiary of a plan. The minimal constraint for a goal is that it is a proper part of a plan. For example, a desire to start a relationship can become a goal if someone decides to take action (or lets someone else take it for her sake) to obtain it. A goal is different from anobjective, because the second one is independent from the cognitive state of a particular physical agent. In practice, an agent (physical or social) may aim at realizing an objective even though the realizing situation conflicts with a goal-situation of the same agent. In 'private' plans of a physical agent, realizing situations usually coincide with goal-situations.
