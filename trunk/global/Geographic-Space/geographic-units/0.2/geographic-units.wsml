 From GEMET: 
 Land cover is the physical state of the land surface. It is the combination of vegetation, soil, rock, water and human-made 
 structures, which make up the earth's landscape. The land cover is the interface between the earth's crust and the atmosphere, 
 influencing the exchange of energy and matter in the climatic system and biogeochemical cycles. (Source: BRS)
